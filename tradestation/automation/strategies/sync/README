_ContinuousAdoptRealWorldPosition Strategies for TradeStation

USE: Insert on any chart along with any strategies where you want the strategies  
to continuously adopt the real-world position (if you are entering manual orders  
to change the position while the strategies are running).  This then allows one to   
continuously interact with a strategy using manual orders and the strategy will   
always stay in sync with the manual position.  
  
You MUST ENABLE ADOPT THE REAL-WORLD POSITION on the Automation Tab of the  
Strategy Properties Window.  You must also enable full automation.  
  
This can be used to test strategies in the Simulation Mode.  
  
  
APPROACH:  Forces all strategies inserted on the same chart to continuously   
Adopt the real-world position (if Adopt the real-world position is enabled  
on the Automation Tab of the Strategy Properties Window) by checking if   
there is a position mismatch between the strategy market position and the  
actual position returned by the Position Provider Object.  If the two are out  
of sync for more than the specified PosMisMatchTimeOutMS parameter, then this  
function throws a RecalcException, which causes all strategies on the chart to restart.  
Assuming that Adopt the real-world position is enabled on the Automation Tab  
this will cause the strategy to re-adopt the correct real-world position.  
  
The PosMisMatchTimeOutMS parameter specifies the number of milliseconds allowed for  
the market position and the actual position to remain out of sync, before the  
recalc exception is thrown to restart all strategies.  A value of 1000 means  
to wait 1,000 milliseconds, or one second before correcting an out of sync  
market position.  It is recommended that you allow one(1) or several seconds  
for the out of sync condition to naturally self-correct, unless you are planning  
to frequently enter manual orders, or that your strategy must very quickly  
respond to changes in the market position (running on ticks).
